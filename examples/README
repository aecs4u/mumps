* Supposing the MUMPS libraries with appropriate arithmetic have been
generated, you may compile the example drivers by typing either

   make (which defaults to make d)
   make s
   make d
   make c
   make z
   make multi
or make all


* For the small C driver, only an example using double arithmetic is available.
  Try for example
    "mpirun -np 3 ./c_example" (parallel version),or
    "./c_example" (sequential version).
  The solution should be (1,2)


* For multiple instances using different arithmetics,
  a small example is available in multiple_arithmetics_example.F.
  Supposing the MUMPS libraries with all arithmetic have been generated,
  you may compile the example driver by typing :

   make multi

   Then try for example:
   	"mpirun -np 3 ./multiple_arithmetics_example" (parallel version), or
   	"./multiple_arithmetics_example" (sequential version).


* A C benchmark driver is available in dmumps_bench.c.
  It builds a 2D Laplacian test matrix and reports the elapsed time of
  JOB=6 (analysis + factorization + solve):
    "./dmumps_bench --ngrid 220 --nrhs 4"
  You can benchmark different BLAS_VENDOR settings from the top-level with:
    "make bench-blas"


* A dense BLAS benchmark driver is available in dgemm_bench.F90.
  It measures DGEMM throughput:
    "./dgemm_bench --m 2048 --n 2048 --k 2048 --iters 3"
  Large matrix case presets are available in:
    "../benchmarks/blas_large_matrix_cases.tsv"
  and can be run from top-level with:
    "make bench-blas-dense"


* For the small Fortran driver, see comments in simpletest.F and try for example
    "mpirun -np 2 ./ssimpletest < input_simpletest_real"
    "mpirun -np 2 ./dsimpletest < input_simpletest_real"
    "mpirun -np 2 ./csimpletest < input_simpletest_cmplx"
    "mpirun -np 2 ./zsimpletest < input_simpletest_cmplx"
  if you are using the parallel version of MUMPS, or

    "./ssimpletest < input_simpletest_real"
    "./dsimpletest < input_simpletest_real"
    "./csimpletest < input_simpletest_cmplx"
    "./zsimpletest < input_simpletest_cmplx"

  if you are using the sequential version.

  The solution should be (1,2,3,4,5)


* For the small Fortran driver using the save/restore feature, see comments in simpletest_save_restore.F and try for example
    "mpirun -np 2 ./ssimpletest_save_restore < input_simpletest_real"
    "mpirun -np 2 ./dsimpletest_save_restore < input_simpletest_real"
    "mpirun -np 2 ./csimpletest_save_restore < input_simpletest_cmplx"
    "mpirun -np 2 ./zsimpletest_save_restore < input_simpletest_cmplx"
  if you are using the parallel version of MUMPS, or

    "./ssimpletest_save_restore < input_simpletest_real"
    "./dsimpletest_save_restore < input_simpletest_real"
    "./csimpletest_save_restore < input_simpletest_cmplx"
    "./zsimpletest_save_restore < input_simpletest_cmplx"

  if you are using the sequential version.

  The solution should be (1,2,3,4,5)


* For the small C driver using the save/restore feature, only an example using double arithmetic is available.
  Try for example
    "mpirun -np 3 ./c_example_save_restore" (parallel version),or
    "./c_example_save_restore" (sequential version).
  The solution should be (1,2)
